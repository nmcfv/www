<img src="./images/people/Leslie.jpg" alt="Leslie Cumiford" style="float:left; margin-top: 6px; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom: 10px"/>

I am thrilled to take the helm of the NM Center for Family Policy, formerly known as TVAC – New Mexico 
(Traditional Values Advocacy Committee of New Mexico). Our Board of Directors has launched a new level of 
operations to meet the challenges of the next decade, and I commend them for it. In part, that direction led to 
our new name, the moving of our headquarters from Farmington to Albuquerque, and the beginning of a series of 
exciting community events such as the June 12 dinner with Pastor Rafael Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz’ father.<p />

Chris Donnelly will remain an integral part of our organization. I would like to thank him for his tireless 
efforts on behalf of life, marriage, the family and religious freedom over the last few years. What I appreciate 
most about Chris, as well as our Board, is the heart that they bring to the issues. Chris and our Board members 
are involved because they are firmly committed to serving the Lord by restoring our society to a culture that 
values the institution of marriage as God set it up, the family as the first and best teacher about life and 
faith, and the understanding that every life is a gift from God with intrinsic value. They are keenly aware 
that we must uphold these values, along with the freedom to express them, if we are to remain a cogent and 
thriving society which is the envy of the entire world. We have seen plenty of examples of society unhinged 
throughout the ages, and we are committed to doing everything that we can to redirect the path of our society 
to a higher calling.<p />

In light of the recent decision by World Vision to support same-sex couples, I want assure you that at 
the heart of our organization remains the staunch commitment to serve New Mexico by supporting life, 
traditional marriage, the family unit and religious freedom. We do so by surveying political candidates, 
creating voter guides to heighten voter awareness of their positions, and informing voters about our issues 
in specific races during the election cycle. To better accomplish these goals, we need an army of volunteers 
networked throughout the state. Over the next few weeks, we will be developing our website and social media 
outreach to render it easier for you to get involved. I invite you to contact us to find out more about the 
ways in which you can make a difference. We will give you the training and know-how that you need to succeed, 
and you will be joining a community of like-minded champions of family values.<p />

Your input and prayers are welcomed and valued as we ramp up to the challenges ahead. After all, a handful 
of us, no matter how talented, cannot accomplish the daunting task before us. However, as a community, through 
God’s wisdom and direction and by His power, we know this transformation is possible. I remind you of Rome. 
Christians were in the minority at the time of Christ, a small band of believers following the Messiah. Within 
a handful of years, Christians went from those likely to be persecuted or relegated to the lower rungs of society 
to those likely to be preferred for high government positions. Roman society turned from rampant sexual 
practices, abortion for convenience and sex selection, and slavery to intact family units with adults who 
valued life and a society that rejected slavery. God and His people have triumphed in this way time and time 
again, and we have every reason to expect that He will do it again, right here in New Mexico.<p />
