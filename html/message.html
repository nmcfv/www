I am thrilled to take the helm of the NM Center for Family Values, formerly known as Voices 
for Family Values, Inc. Our Board of Directors has launched a new level of operations 
to meet the challenges of the next decade, and I commend them for it. In part, that 
direction led to our new name, the moving of our headquarters from Farmington to 
Albuquerque, and the planning of a whole new level of involvement for churches, civic 
groups and individuals.

Chris Donnelly will remain an integral part of our organization. I would like to thank him 
for his tireless efforts on behalf of life, marriage, the family and religious freedom 
over the last few years. What I appreciate most about Chris, as well as our Board, is the 
heart that they bring to the issues. Chris and our Board members are involved because they 
are firmly committed to serving the Lord by restoring our society to a culture that values 
the institution of marriage as God set it up, the family as the first and best teacher 
about life and faith, and the understanding that every life is a gift from God with 
intrinsic value. They are keenly aware that we must uphold these values, along with the 
freedom to express them, if we are to remain a cogent and thriving society which is the 
envy of the entire world. We have seen plenty of examples of society unhinged throughout 
the ages, and we are committed to doing everything that we can to redirect the path of 
our society to a higher calling.<p />

In light of the recent decision by World Vision to support same-sex couples (which was 
quickly retracted), I want assure you that at the heart of our organization remains 
the staunch commitment to serve New Mexico by supporting life, traditional marriage, 
the family unit and religious freedom. We do so by educating the public and networking 
with other organizations regarding the advantages of supporting life, traditional 
marriage, family and religious freedom and the dangers of veering from this course. We 
also keep New Mexicans informed on a timely basis regarding issues at all levels – 
municipal, state and federal – that impact family values and religious freedom. To better 
accomplish these goals, we need an army of volunteers networked throughout the state. 
Over the next few weeks, we will be developing our website and social media outreach 
to render it easier for you to get involved. I invite you to contact us to find out 
more about the ways in which you can make a difference. We will give you the training 
and know-how that you need to succeed, and you will be joining a community of like-minded 
champions of family values.<p />

Your input and prayers are welcome and valued as we ramp up to the challenges ahead. 
After all, a handful of us, no matter how talented, cannot accomplish the daunting 
task before us. However, as a community, through God’s wisdom and direction and by 
His power, we know this transformation is possible. I remind you of Rome. Christians 
were in the minority at the time of Christ, a small band of believers following the 
Messiah. Within a handful of years, Christians went from those likely to be persecuted 
or relegated to the lower rungs of society to those likely to be preferred for high 
government positions. Roman society turned from rampant sexual practices, abortion 
for convenience and sex selection, and slavery to intact family units with adults 
who valued life and a society that rejected slavery. God and His people have triumphed 
in this way time and time again, and we have every reason to expect that He will do 
it again, right here in New Mexico.<p />

As I prayed about this opportunity, the Scripture that most spoke to me was from Isaiah 
57. The first half of this chapter describes a situation in which the righteous perish, 
various sexual proclivities abound while participants sneer and mock, children are 
sacrificed and idols are worshiped. But then (verse 13) the people begin to take 
refuge in the Lord, and it is said (verse 14) “Build up, build up, prepare 
the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.” The Lord then 
promises to heal them, guide them and restore comfort to them.<p />

As we build the road and remove the obstacles to restore the Land of Enchantment, we 
invite you to join us, living a life worthy of the Lord’s pleasure when he says, 
"Well done, good and faithful servant."
