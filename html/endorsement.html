As a board member of the NM Center for Family Policy, formally TVAC, I urge you to participate in the 
June 12 dinner featuring Pastor Rafael Cruz. During my time serving New Mexico as Lt. Governor, I 
realized that every opposition group was represented in government, and those of us with traditional 
family values needed a venue to voice our opinion to government. We need elected officials who share 
our views rather than those who want to alter our society to something that we would not recognize. 
This fundraiser will help us to identify and inform voters about candidates in Novemberâ€™s races who 
care about promoting the kind of family values (life, traditional marriage and religious freedom) 
upon which our country became great. Pastor Cruz will further emphasize how important this fight is 
for our future, as well as the future of our children and grandchildren.<p />

Walter Bradley<p />

Vice President
